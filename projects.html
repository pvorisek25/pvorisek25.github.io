                    <p class="text">You see, I am a very busy person. I can't afford sinking 10 hours a day into programming like you can! Not even in the summer. You know what is the core problem? The problem of not having any of my projects fully completed yet? It's because unlike you, pal, I program in C++ which requires far more brainpower than some Python to comprehend. Unlike you, I am not stuck with that silly Python thingy like you are for 3 years now. Do you even know any other programming language other than Python? Like, do you know that there are also strongly-typed languages out there? You might, but your brain walled-off that memory because it was too traumatic for you. After you tried C that one time and got PTSD because of it. It is rather pathetic that you can't declare variables with their own data types. And donâ€™t get me started on the time when you tried to use an external library in one of your miserable C 'projects'. When you found out that you can't type a single command into console and then just add one line of code to your single-file project. You cried for hours and I had a good laugh.That is one of our main differences, I am just better than you.</p>
