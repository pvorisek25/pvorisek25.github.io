                    <p class="text">You see, I am a very busy person. I can't afford sinking 10 hours a day into programming like you can! Not even in the summer. You know what is the core problem? The problem of not having any of my projects fully completed yet? It's because unlike you, pal, I program in C++ which requires far more brainpower than some Python to comprehend. Unlike you, I am not stuck with that silly Python thingy like you are for 3 years now. Do you even know any other programming language other than Python? And not, HTML is not a programming language. Like, do you know that there are also strongly-typed languages out there? You might, but your brain walled-off that memory because it was too traumatic for you. After you tried C that one time and got PTSD because of it. It is rather pathetic that you can't declare variables with their own data types. And donâ€™t get me started on the time when you tried to use an external library in one of your simple and miserable C 'projects'. When you found out that you can't type a single command into console and then just add one line of code to your single-file project. You cried for hours and I had a good laugh. You're own mother had to come to the room to calm you down. Unlike you I have lots of responsibilities. I am not living in my mother's basement and receivening unemployment benefits like you are. Yours are even higher that most disabled veteran's. Did you really think you have some future, some potential. You barely made it to highschool and even then you got there only because your dear parents had some connections to the school board. But you're so big of a failure that even money couldn't get you to college. And have you ever felt the touch of a woman in your life? Oh, I forgot, only your mother's. That's not a big of a surprise to me though. Have you ever looked at a mirror, not even a gay would like to look at you for more than a minute. I bet that severly injured soldiers of WW1 looked much better than you. You would have been dead already if abortion hadn't been illegal. That's the main reason we should fight for women's rights. You're just piece of flesh unnecessarily occupying too much space. You're the society's biggest burden, hindering the progress of the whole humanity. Do you feel pround now, accomplished? That is one of our main differences, I am just better than you.</p>
